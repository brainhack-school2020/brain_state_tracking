## Introdiction

LOOKING TO JOIN ANOTHER PROJECT

The human brain has a remarkable capacity to rapidly adapt to ever-changing environment and undergo plastic changes. These changes can be observed across different time-scales, ranging from seconds to years, and are believed to form the mechanism by which the brain encodes experience and learns new skills. How does the brain implement executive control and generate skill-based behavior? When does actual experience drive neural plasticity and what are the factors that may influence this process? What are the prerequisites for successful long-term memory retention and what are its neurophysiological constraints?
In my research, I use a multimodal approach combining behavioral psychophysics and neuroimaging to investigate skilled motor behavior in humans. I am particularly interested in exploring factors that support and, therefore, may predict successful encoding, consolidation and long-term retention of new experience. This knowledge provides a scientific basis for developing effective training protocols in healthy young population, encourages new neuro-rehabilitative approaches to alleviate motor deficits during physiological aging, and may also benefit implementation of assistive technology geared to help people with impaired mobility.

## Project definition
My big goal is to study time-varying patterns in fMRI data on multiple time-scales:
 - from seconds to several hours
 - across different sessions/days
 - during different physiological states
 
Therefore, I want to learn about the existing techniques/tools to study brain state dynamics and to gain some experience in how to impliment them within the Python environment.
I am particularly interested in techniques that are capable to capture instantaneous changes in local- and network-level activity.
It may include but is not limited to:
 - sliding window analysis
 - single time-frame analysis
 - generation of connectivity matrices for dynamic connectivity analysis
 - effective representation of brain activation patterns
 
### Tools 
 - Nilearn
 - Dynamic connectivity toolboxes?

### Data 
Any preprocessed data or data from my project (it is already preprocessed)
